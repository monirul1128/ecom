# Queue Worker Setup Using Laravel Scheduler

This guide explains how to set up a Laravel queue worker using Laravel's built-in scheduler, which is the recommended approach for handling scheduled tasks.

## What We've Implemented

Laravel's scheduler has been configured in `routes/console.php` to:

-   Run the queue worker every minute
-   Prevent overlapping executions
-   Set a 90-second timeout to prevent memory leaks
-   Retry failed jobs up to 3 times
-   Stop when the queue is empty
-   Run in the background for better performance

## Laravel Scheduler Configuration

The scheduler is now configured in `routes/console.php`:

```php
Schedule::command('queue:work --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground();
```

## cPanel Cron Job Setup

### Step 1: Single Cron Job Required

With Laravel's scheduler, you only need **one cron job** that runs Laravel's scheduler:

```
* * * * * cd /home/username/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

### Step 2: Customize the Path

Replace the following in the cron command:

-   `username`: Your cPanel username
-   `public_html`: Your Laravel application directory

#### Common Directory Variations:

-   Standard: `/home/username/public_html`
-   Subdomain: `/home/username/subdomain.yourdomain.com`
-   Custom directory: `/home/username/custom_folder`

### Step 3: Alternative Frequency Options

If you want to run the scheduler less frequently:

#### Every 5 Minutes:

```
*/5 * * * * cd /home/username/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

#### Every 10 Minutes:

```
*/10 * * * * cd /home/username/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

## Advantages of Laravel Scheduler

### 1. **Single Cron Job**

-   Only one cron job needed for all scheduled tasks
-   Laravel handles the scheduling logic internally

### 2. **Better Integration**

-   Native Laravel functionality
-   Automatic logging and error handling
-   Built-in overlapping prevention

### 3. **Flexible Scheduling**

-   Easy to modify schedules without changing cron jobs
-   Rich scheduling API (everyMinute, hourly, daily, etc.)
-   Conditional scheduling based on environment

### 4. **Built-in Features**

-   `withoutOverlapping()`: Prevents multiple instances
-   `runInBackground()`: Non-blocking execution
-   Command-line options for queue worker configuration

## Testing the Setup

### 1. **Test the Scheduler Manually**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/laravel/app
php artisan schedule:run
```

### 2. **List Scheduled Commands**

```bash
php artisan schedule:list
```

### 3. **Test Queue Worker Directly**

```bash
php artisan queue:work --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Enable Scheduler Logging

Add logging to monitor the scheduler:

```
* * * * * cd /home/username/public_html && php artisan schedule:run >> storage/logs/scheduler.log 2>&1
```

### Check Scheduler Status

```bash
# View scheduled tasks
php artisan schedule:list

# Check queue status
php artisan queue:failed

# Monitor queue processing
php artisan queue:work --once
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Queues

If you have multiple queues, you can schedule them separately:

```php
// In routes/console.php
Schedule::command('queue:work --queue=high --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground();

Schedule::command('queue:work --queue=default,low --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground();
```

### Environment-Specific Scheduling

```php
Schedule::command('queue:work --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground()
    ->when(function () {
        return app()->environment('production');
    });
```

### Additional Queue Worker Options

You can customize the queue worker with these command-line options:

```php
Schedule::command('queue:work --timeout=90 --tries=3 --stop-when-empty --max-jobs=100 --memory=128')
    ->everyMinute()
    ->withoutOverlapping()
    ->runInBackground();
```

**Available Options:**

-   `--timeout=90`: Job timeout in seconds
-   `--tries=3`: Number of times to attempt a job
-   `--stop-when-empty`: Stop when queue is empty
-   `--max-jobs=100`: Stop after processing 100 jobs
-   `--max-time=3600`: Stop after running for 1 hour
-   `--memory=128`: Stop when memory usage exceeds 128MB
-   `--sleep=3`: Sleep for 3 seconds when no jobs available
-   `--queue=high,default`: Process specific queues

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Scheduler Not Running**

    - Verify the cron job is active in cPanel
    - Check if the path to your Laravel app is correct
    - Ensure PHP has execute permissions

2. **Queue Jobs Not Processing**

    - Check queue driver configuration in `.env`
    - Verify queue tables exist: `php artisan queue:table`
    - Check for failed jobs: `php artisan queue:failed`

3. **Permission Issues**
    - Ensure the cron job user has access to the Laravel directory
    - Check file permissions on storage and logs directories

### Debug Commands:

```bash
# Test scheduler manually
php artisan schedule:run

# List all scheduled tasks
php artisan schedule:list

# Check queue status
php artisan queue:work --once

# View failed jobs
php artisan queue:failed

# Clear failed jobs
php artisan queue:flush
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management

-   The scheduler automatically handles memory cleanup
-   `withoutOverlapping()` prevents resource conflicts
-   `--timeout=90` limits job execution time

### Resource Usage

-   `runInBackground()` prevents blocking
-   `--stop-when-empty` saves resources when no jobs exist
-   Automatic cleanup of completed jobs

## Security Considerations

-   The scheduler runs with the same permissions as the cron job
-   Failed jobs are logged for debugging
-   Consider using a dedicated user for production environments
-   Regularly monitor scheduler logs for issues

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Every Minute**: Begin with `* * * * *` for active applications
2. **Monitor Performance**: Watch server resources and adjust frequency as needed
3. **Use Logging**: Enable scheduler logging for debugging
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test in development before production
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure queue data is backed up regularly

## Migration from Custom Commands

If you were previously using custom Artisan commands:

1. Remove the custom command from `routes/console.php`
2. Replace with the scheduler configuration
3. Update your cron job to use `php artisan schedule:run`
4. Test thoroughly before deploying to production
